################### PIXEL OPERATIONS ######################

# grayPixel: pixel -> pixel
# compute and return a gray pixel with the same intensity
# as the given pixel. A little complication: the intensity
# values in the 3D numpy array representing the pixels are
# expressed as 8-bit integers. The range is 0..255. The
# problem is that if one adds together three of these, to
# get aonther 8-bit integer, there can be an overflow! So
# we convert the 8-bit integers to values of type "int" before
# we do the addition. The "int" type in Python can hold
# integer values of any size.

def grayPixel(pixel):
    red_intensity = int(pixel[0])
    green_intensity = int(pixel[1])
    blue_intensity = int(pixel[2])
    ave_intensity = (red_intensity + green_intensity + blue_intensity)//3
    
    return ((ave_intensity, ave_intensity, ave_intensity))

# channel: pixel -> channel -> pixel
# return a gray pixel with intensity from given channel of given pixel
def channel(pixel,chan):
    return (pixel[chan],pixel[chan],pixel[chan])


# inverse: pixel -> pixel
# return the color negative of the given pixel
def inverse(pixel):
    return (255-pixel[0], 255-pixel[1], 255-pixel[2])


# intensify: pixel -> nat255 -> pixel
# brighten each channel of pixel by quantity
#
# NOTE: there might be an overflow bug in this code!
# If so, reason through it and fix it. Consider the
# possible need for a function that brightens an
# individual pixel intensity, never returning a result
# greater than 255 or less than 0.
